📌 **Week 2 Challenge Submission – Multi-Page Responsive Barber Shop Website**

✅ **What I Have Done:**

🧭 **Built a multi-page website** for a classic barber shop, including **Home**, **About**, **Services**, **Prices**, **Bookings**, and **Contact** pages. Each page uses semantic HTML to ensure a structured, accessible, and professional online presence.  

🔧 **Utilized Flexbox** for layout:
- The **navigation bar** is sticky and fixed at the top, with evenly spaced links. On smaller screens, it collapses into a vertical menu.
- The **About** section features an image and short bio text, aligned horizontally (or vertically on smaller screens).
- The **Services** section showcases grooming options with styled cards, arranged in a responsive grid.
- The **Prices** section displays packages and costs in a clear layout.
- The **Bookings** page includes a styled booking form with date, time, service, and contact fields.
- The **Contact** page contains a contact form with clickable email and phone links.

🎨 **Applied CSS**:
- Used CSS variables for consistent colours, fonts, and spacing.
- External stylesheet controls layout, colours, fonts, and spacing.
- Google Fonts (Montserrat) used for a professional look.
- Hover effects and transitions added to buttons and cards.

🖼️ **Included Pseudo-elements**:
- Used `::after` for animated underlines on navigation links, expanding smoothly on hover.

📱 **Ensured Full Responsiveness**:
- Media queries make the site mobile- and tablet-friendly.
- Content reflows properly, and navigation adapts into a collapsible menu.
- Images and layout elements resize proportionally across devices.

🧾 **Footer Section**:
- Created a footer with copyright information and illustration credits.

🚀 **Deployment on GitHub Pages**:
🔗 - Code pushed to a public GitHub repository:👉 https://github.com/bariskoca27/Week-2 
🔗 - Site successfully deployed and accessible at:👉 https://bariskoca27.github.io/Week-2/

🌍 **Summary**:
This challenge helped me practice semantic HTML, external CSS styling, responsive Flexbox layouts, form creation, and GitHub Pages deployment.  
The site is now fully functional and live online. 🌐✅
